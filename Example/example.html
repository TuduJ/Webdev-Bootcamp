            <!--First Column-->
            <p>Hippos are recognisable by their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine tusks,
                nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) and 1,300 kg
                (2,870 lb) for males and females respectively. Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of
                running 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances.</p>

            <!--Third Column-->
            <p>Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of
                river and groups of five to thirty females and young hippos. During the day, they remain cool by staying
                in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on
                grasses. While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are
                not territorial on land. The hippo is among the most dangerous animals in the world as it is highly
                aggressive and unpredictable. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory
                canine teeth.</p>
